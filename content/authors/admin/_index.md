I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [Prof. Michael Snyder's lab](https://med.stanford.edu/snyderlab/about.html) at Stanford University School of Medicine. My overarching research interests are bioinformatics algorithms development for multi-omics data, and their application to precision medicine. Specifically, I am interested in bioinformatics algorithm development, including 1) Comprehensive analysis workflow and deep learning for LC-MS data, 2) Metabolic network analysis, 3) Wearable and multi-omics data integration, and 4) microbiome and metabolome data integration. I also employed the developed bioinformatics algorithms as a unique systems biology approach to study the potential biomarkers and mechanisms of 1) pregnancy and related diseases, 2) aging and related diseases, and 3) cancer. 
More tools and projects I developed can be found in the [Projects](#projects) part.
