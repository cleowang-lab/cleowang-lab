My research interest is in developing deep learning-based tools for optimizing the processing of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data. By leveraging large language models to automate data quality assessment, I aim to enhance the application of metabolomics in precision medicine, improving biomarker discovery and early disease diagnosis.
