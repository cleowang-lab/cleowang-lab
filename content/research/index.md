Our overarching research interests are bioinformatics algorithms development for multi-omics and wearable data, and their application to precision medicine and biological questions.

# ðŸ’» Method Development For Multi-Omics and Wearable Data

## ðŸ§¬ Mass Spectrometry Data 

Research is defined as the creation of new knowledge and/or the use of existing knowledge in a new and creative way so as to generate new concepts, methodologies and understandings. This could include synthesis and analysis of previous research to the extent that it leads to new and creative outcomes.
