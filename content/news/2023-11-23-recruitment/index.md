**Job Opportunities in Wang Lab at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore**

**Institution Overview**

Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, is a world-renowned research-intensive university, ranked **15th globally in the 2025 QS World University Rankings**. NTU is recognized for its academic excellence, groundbreaking research, and global outlook. The university offers a vibrant, interdisciplinary research environment with state-of-the-art facilities and comprehensive support services.

**About the Lab**

Dr. **Chuchu Wang** will join NTU’s **Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine)** as an Assistant Professor in **November 2025** and has been awarded the prestigious **Nanyang Assistant Professorship (NAP)** grant. The lab will be well-funded and housed in a dynamic and collaborative research environment.

Dr. Wang received her Ph.D. in Cell Biology in 2019 under the supervision of Dr. Cong Liu at the Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. From 2020 to 2025, she conducted postdoctoral research at Stanford University under the guidance of HHMI Investigator **Prof. Axel Brunger**, focusing on structural and molecular neuroscience.

**Research Focus**

Our interdisciplinary lab combines **in situ structural biology (cryo-EM/ET, in-cell NMR)**, **mass spectrometry-based lipidomics and proteomics**, **cell biology**, **bioinformatics**, and **molecular biology** to investigate the physiological and pathological mechanisms of **human aging and neurodegenerative diseases**.

The lab aims to integrate multi-omics, molecular structural analysis, and biochemical/cellular experiments to uncover **lipid–protein interactions in age-related disorders**, with the ultimate goal of identifying early diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies to promote healthy aging.

We welcome applicants from diverse backgrounds (e.g., neuroscience, biophysics, biochemistry, bioinformatics), who are passionate about impactful, translational research.

**Collaborations**

Our lab maintains active collaborations with leading institutions in the **US, Singapore, and China**, offering lab members the opportunity to engage with top-tier researchers globally.
