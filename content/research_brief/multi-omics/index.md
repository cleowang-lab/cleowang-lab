Our lab's research focuses on integrating multi-omics and wearable data to advance the field of precision medicine, with a special emphasis on understanding the intricate interplay between the microbiome and metabolome. Our research likely involves analyzing how the microbiome affects the metabolome and vice versa. For instance, certain metabolites produced by the microbiome can impact human metabolic pathways, while changes in the host's metabolism can alter the microbiome composition. Understanding this bidirectional relationship is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. The ultimate goal of our lab's research is to use the integrated data from multi-omics and wearables for precision medicine. By understanding the complex interactions between the microbiome and metabolome, and how they relate to individual physiological states, our aim to develop personalized healthcare strategies. This could involve tailored dietary recommendations, customized probiotic or prebiotic therapies, or specific drug treatments based on an individual's unique microbiome-metabolome profile.
