Aging is a complex biological process characterized by a gradual decline in physiological functions, which increases susceptibility to diseases and death. This process is influenced by a myriad of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Our research on aging and aging-related diseases like AD and PD is utilizing multi-omics and wearable technology to gain a comprehensive understanding of the aging process. The ultimate goal of our research is to develop predictive models for aging and aging-related diseases. These models aim to integrate multi-omics data with information from wearable devices, along with clinical and demographic information. Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms are employed to analyze this vast and complex dataset, with the objective of identifying patterns and predictive biomarkers. In summary, our lab's research represents a cutting-edge, interdisciplinary approach to studying aging, leveraging the power of multi-omics and wearable technology to build comprehensive predictive models for aging and its related diseases. This research not only deepens our understanding of the biological processes of aging but also holds promise for improving health outcomes in the aging population.
